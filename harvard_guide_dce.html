		<h2>Division of Continuing Education</h2>

			Faculty of Arts and Sciences is responsible for four major programs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Harvard Summer School</li>
				<li>Harvard Extension School</li>
				<li>Harvard Institute for English Language Programs</li>

			</ul>
			<p>The combined enrollments in these programs approaches 20,000.</p>
		<h3>Harvard Summer School</h3>
			<p>The Harvard Summer School, founded in 1871,
				is the oldest academic summer session in the United States.
				Each summer more than 5,000 students of all 
				ages come to Harvard from every state and nearly 80
				foreign countries to study for eight weeks with
				faculty from Harvard and other major American and 
				foreign universities. The open-enrollment program 
				sponsors nearly 200 day and evening courses in more 
				than 45 liberal arts fields.</p>
			<p>The Summer School features a selective 
				college-level program for highly qualified 
				secondary school students, the Ukrainian Summer 
				Institute, as well as courses in premedical 
				sciences, expository and creative writing, 
				economics, and many foreign languages, among others.</p>
		<h3>Harvard Extension School</h3>
			<p>The Harvard Extension School was founded by Harvard 
				President A. Lawrence Lowell in 1909 as an academic 
				evening program designed to serve the educational 
				interests and needs of the Greater Boston 
				community. The features of the Extension School 
				have remained constant from the beginning: open 
				enrollment, part-time evening study at Harvard, 
				coeducation for all ages, modest tuition rates, a 
				distinguished faculty drawn primarily from Harvard 
				University, and the opportunity to study for 
				personal enrichment, career advancement, or degrees 
				or certificates.</p>
			<p>More than 550 courses are offered each year, 
				including health and computer sciences, liberal 
				arts, administration and management, many foreign 
				languages, and expository and creative writing, to 
				nearly 13,000 students of all ages. In 91 years of 
				operation, the Extension School has provided 
				instruction to more than 350,000 people.</p>
			<p>Some 5,000 degrees and certificates have been 
				granted in the Extension School undergraduate and 
				graduate programs.</p>
		<h3>Harvard Institute for English Language Programs</h3>
			<p>The Harvard Institute for English Language Programs 
				was founded in 1950 to meet the language needs of 
				post-World War II immigrants to the United States. 
				During the academic year, the Institute offers 
				part-time day and evening programs to non-native 
				speakers from the Greater Boston community. During 
				the summer session, intensive day, part-time 
				evening, and a number of business programs are 
				offered. The combined enrollment for the 
				Institute's summer and academic year programs is 
				more than 2,100.</p>
	  <h3>Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement</h3>
			<p>The Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement 
				was founded in 1977 to provide retirees an 
				opportunity to pursue intellectual interests and 
				explore new areas of learning in peer-taught study 
				groups. More than 500 women and men, ranging in age 
				from their fifties to their eighties, participate 
				in the program each year.</p>
